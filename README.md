# Understanding State Management in valtio
1. Reactivity: valtio makes the state reactive by using proxies. Any changes to the state are automatically tracked, and components that use useSnapshot will re-render when the state changes.

2. Simplified API: Compared to other state management solutions, valtio provides a simpler API. You don't need actions, reducers, or selectors. Instead, you directly modify the proxy state, and valtio takes care of the reactivity.

3. Type Safety: Since youâ€™re using TypeScript, your state and actions are strongly typed, reducing the chances of errors.
